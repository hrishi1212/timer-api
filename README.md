# timer-api

to start with project application you must have node and npm install in your local machine 
download or clone this project 

after cloning the project in working directory type 

npm install command to install all node modules 

after installing node modules 

the npm start command will start the server and 
command mongod will start MongoDB server both should run concurrently in one terminal run npm start and in other 
the terminal in same working directory run mongod to run MongoDB server

I have created server API which will connect to MongoDB and fetch as well as save the timer object into MongoDB
I preferred using Nodejs because I have some experience to create simple curd operation in MongoDB

the time required to create this project or backend was half an hour because there is only 2 operation one
to fetch all records and other to add a single record. 

I have used mongoose for backend activity to add records in MongoDB which is very simple to use 

there are no such things I didn't like in project I created to create and read operation. 

if I would have more time I would have created same backend operation in PHP as I am working and have good experience in PHP
language
