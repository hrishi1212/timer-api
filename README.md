# timer-api

I have created server API which will connect to MongoDB and fetch as well as save the timer object into MongoDB
I preferred using Nodejs because I have some experience to create simple curd operation in MongoDB

the time required to create this project or backend was half an hour because there is only 2 operation one
to fetch all records and other to add a single record. 

I have used mongoose for backend activity to add records in MongoDB which is very simple to use 

there are no such things I didn't like in project I created to create and read operation. 

if I would have more time I would have created same backend operation in PHP as I am working and have good experience in PHP
language
